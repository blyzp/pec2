                        of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of
                        Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because
                        there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks
                        and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn't
                        listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial
                        into the belt and made herself on the way.
